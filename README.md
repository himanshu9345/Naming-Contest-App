# Naming-Contest-App
Built an application to create naming contests and have users propose new names for every contest. I have use MongoDB for the database, using Node as both an API server on top of  MongoDB, and as a web server to host all of our assets, and use React on the front end to consume our API data and build a user interface suitable for the features.
